Title: Introduction to Text Mining: Techniques and Applications

Workshop Description: 

What is text mining? Text mining has become a popular technique for data analysis both in industry and the academic sector. This beginner-friendly workshop will introduce the basics of text-mining, explore pre-processing techniques, and leave attendees with the basic tools to get started in text analysis for their own work. This workshop is great for those in the humanities and social sciences who are interested in incorporating more technological methods in their work as a tool for understanding. No coding experience needed. 

In the workshop, we will complete the following text-mining exercises:
- Explore the Voyant Tools Software 
- Using the NLTK Toolkit 
- Conduct semantic analysis through word clouds and bar/pie charts 

There are three files present in the workshop repository. 
- Instructor Key: This template is the same as the student template but with the code cells complete. 
- Student Key: This template is without the pre-written code, and should be used to complete the excercise. If difficulties arise, the Instructor Key should be referenced. 
- trump_tweets.csv: Contains a csv file of Donald Trump's tweets in 2016-2020 related to categories of immigration; the csv has already been "cleaned" and "filtered"
